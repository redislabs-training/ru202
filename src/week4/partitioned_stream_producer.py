# Use Case: Partitioned Stream Example with Python
# Usage: Part of Redis University RU202 courseware
#
# Simulates a temperature logging device that
# continuously outputs new temperature readings, and
# pushes them into a date-partitioned set of streams
# in Redis.  A new stream is created for each new
# day, and set to expire a few days after creation
# to ensure that memory usage is managed.
#
# The producer starts at a configurable date and
# generates readings for a configurable number of days
# at a configurable interval.  By default it starts
# on January 1st 2025, generating 10 days worth of
# data at 1 second intervals.
