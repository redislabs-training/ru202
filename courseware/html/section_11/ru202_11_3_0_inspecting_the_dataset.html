<p>Let's verify that the producer created all the data, and set the expiry times on the streams.</p>
<p>Using the terminal, start <span class="code">redis-cli</span> then we'll look at the lengths, expiry times, and contents of the stream partitions that were created.</p>
<h2>1. Checking Stream Lengths</h2>
<p>First, check the number of messages that the producer put into each day's stream partition:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
$ redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> XLEN temps:20250101
(integer) 86400
</pre></p>
<p>Here we see that the stream contains 86,400 messages (one for every second of the day).  All 10 stream partitions that were created should contain the same number of messages.  You can verify this by running the <span class="code">XLEN</span> command for another partition, for example <span class="code">temps:20250103</span>.
</p>
<h2>2. Checking Stream Expiry</h2>
<p>Next, check how long each stream partition has left until it expires:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
127.0.0.1:6379> TTL temps:20250101
(integer) 178787320
127.0.0.1:6379> TTL temps:20250102
(integer) 178873689
</pre></p>
<p>You should notice that <span class="code">temps:20250101</span> has the shortest time to expiry (because it contains the oldest data), and <span class="code">temps:20250110</span> the longest (because it contains the newest data).</p>
<p>The TTLs on these keys are very large as our scenario assumes we started writing data on January 1st 2025.  This means that the stream that we finished writing at the end of January 1st 2025 won't expire until the beginning of January 4th 2025.</p>
<h2>3. Looking at the Messages</h2>
<p>Finally, let's see what the messages look like using <span class="code">XRANGE</span>:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
127.0.0.1:6379> XRANGE temps:20250105 - + COUNT 2
1) 1) "1736035200000-0"
   2) 1) "temp_f"
      2) "73"
2) 1) "1736035201000-0"
   2) 1) "temp_f"
      2) "72"
</pre></p>
<p>Each message&apos;s ID is the millisecond timestamp that the temperature reading is for (<span class="code">1736035200000</span> = January 5th 2025 at 00:00 for example).  The payload is a single item named <span class="code">temp_f</span> whose value is the temperature reading in Fahrenheit.</p>
