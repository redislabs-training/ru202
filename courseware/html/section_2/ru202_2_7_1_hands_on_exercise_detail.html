<h2>The Producer</h2>
<p>This exercise assumes that you have cloned the course <a href="https://github.com/redislabs-training/ru202" target="_blank" class="page-link">GitHub repository</a> and followed the <a href="https://github.com/redislabs-training/ru202/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank" class="page-link">setup instructions</a>.  Note that you will need to activate your Python virtual environment and set any required environment variables for each new terminal session that you use here.</p>
<p>Now that you have your environment up and running, let's try starting each of the components, beginning with the producer.  Using one terminal window, type:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
cd src/intro   
python producer.py
</pre></p>
<p>You should see the producer start up, and begin adding temperature messages to the stream.  The output should look like this:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
$ python producer.py
Wrote {"postal_code": 94016, "temp_f": 51} with ID 1554921766941-0
Wrote {"postal_code": 94016, "temp_f": 50} with ID 1554921767946-0
Wrote {"postal_code": 94016, "temp_f": 51} with ID 1554921768948-0
Wrote {"postal_code": 94016, "temp_f": 52} with ID 1554921769949-0
Wrote {"postal_code": 94016, "temp_f": 51} with ID 1554921770953-0
</pre></p>
<p>Leave the producer running.</p>
<h2>The Consumers</h2>
<p>Next, we'll start the both the data warehouse and rolling average consumer processes. Go ahead and enter these commands into a second terminal window:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
cd src/intro
./run-consumers.sh
</pre></p>
<p>The data warehouse consumer will start reading from the stream and produce output similar to the following:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
$ ./run-consumers.sh
Wrote [["stream:weather", [["1554922470338-0", {"postal_code": "94016", "temp_f": "34"}]]]] to data warehouse.

Wrote [["stream:weather", [["1554922471341-0", {"postal_code": "94016", "temp_f": "33"}]]]] to data warehouse.

Wrote [["stream:weather", [["1554922472342-0", {"postal_code": "94016", "temp_f": "32"}]]]] to data warehouse.
</pre></p>
<p>The rolling average consumer will also start, and its log output will be in yellow.  You can expect to see output similar to that shown below.</p>
<p><pre class="code">

<h2>Stopping the System</h2>
<p>To stop the producer, click on the its terminal window in your lab environment and press <span class="code">Ctrl + C</span>.</p>
<p>Stop both consumers by using the idle terminal window to run a script:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
./stop-consumers.sh
</pre></p>
